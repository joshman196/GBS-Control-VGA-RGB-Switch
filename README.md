# VGA-RGB Switch for the GBS Control
A very simple PCB containing a 100-ohm resistor and a switch to toggle between VGA and "TV" RGB (75-ohm termination). Comes in surface mount and through hole styles.

**Note:** The current wording of the switch says "off" and "on" because I originally named it a VGA switch, but this is technically a flawed way of looking at it. In this case, just be aware that "off" means TV RGB (75-ohm termination) and "on" means VGA (like with Dreamcast VGA output or otherwise). I may eventually change this, but I had this sitting on my drive for almost three years and just wanted to make it public already.

Wiring is shown in the last picture below, although you can alternatively wire the top right pad to the big ground pin next to the VGA input, as well as wiring the top left pad to the big "S"/Sync pin next to the VGA input.

## Parts Needed
- A 100-ohm resistor, 0805 size for surface mount
- SPST switch, I used one of [these](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2255800031738457.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt)
